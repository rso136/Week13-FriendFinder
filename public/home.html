			<h4><b>What people are saying about Friendway:</b></h4>
			<br>
			<p><i>"Friendway networked me with people in the city I likely would have never met on my own. They not only shared my interests but also fit into my unique personality template. Thanks Friendway!"</i></p>
			<p>- Andrew Faulkner, Local Restaurant Critic</p>
			<br>
			<p><i>"Most people assume being a celebrity means everyone wants to be your friend. That isn't true at all. Being famous is one of the loneliest places in the world. Friendway matched me with ordinary people who weren't out to get my autograph and now I have a circle of friends who I can genuinely call my best buds."</i></p>
			<p>- Giovanna Maccari, Aspiring Actress and Fashion Designer</p>
			<br>
			<p><i>"My line of work keeps me in the office for long hours and so its hard for me to meet new people in person. That's why I really love Friendway. It's like meeting a person face-to-face without ever needing to leave my chair. I now have a queue of people just waiting to meet me!</i></p>
			<p>- Gregory B. Jackson, Freelance Gaming QA
